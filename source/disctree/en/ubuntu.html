<p>Ubuntu is a complete open source operating system suitable for desktops and servers. The base system and all included software is free, and support is available from the community or by professional support providers. "Ubuntu" is an ancient African word, meaning "humanity to others". The Ubuntu distribution brings the spirit of Ubuntu to the software world.</p>

<p>This is a <i>Live Ubuntu CD</i> that can be run directly from your CD drive. Simply leave this CD in your drive and reboot the computer to run a demo of Ubuntu. Nothing will be installed on your computer, nor will your current system  be altered in any way.<br><br></p>

<h4>A brief tour</h4>
<p>The standard user interface is based around the <i>Gnome</i> desktop environment. When you start the system for the first time you are greeted by a desktop that is unusually clean and tidy. No desktop icons by default! Even the recycling bin has been moved down to the taskbar. The default theme is designed to be easy on the eye. But Linux is inherently flexible; you can customise the look and behavior of the desktop in a range of ways, from simply changing the default theme to selecting a different desktop environment altogether, such as <i>KDE</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Applications</i> menu gives you access to a selection of useful programs, such as Firefox and OpenOffice.org. The <i>Places</i> menu provides access to local files and network locations, while the <i>System</i> menu contains system settings. Ubuntu includes more than 1,000 supported pieces of software, starting with the Linux kernel version 2.6 with Gnome 2.14, and covering every standard desktop application from word processing to programming tools. If you should require more software, simply use the <i>Add Application</i> utility to download and install programs from the freely available software repository. The <i>Universe</i> repository features a further 10 000 applications.</p><br />
