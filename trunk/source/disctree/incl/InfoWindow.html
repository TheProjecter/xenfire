<h3>About TheOpenCD browser</h3>
    <p>This CD browser is built with open source technology. It uses a Gecko rendering engine to display content stored in HTML or XML files, just like pages on the web. These HTML pages were in part generated by a new on-line build system called <a href="orchard_web.lch">Orchard</a>, but a fair amount of tweaking was also done by hand. The browser technology and content was assembled by Phil Harper, Will Martin, Brett McNamara, Matt Oquist, Henrik Nilsen Omma and the over 100 participants in TheOpenCD project.</p>
    <p>We would like to thank the Mozilla project for developing the Gecko engine, <a href="kmeleon_web.lch">K-Meleon</a> for making the light-weight and flexible browser implementation we have used and finally all the projects who have made the excellent free software on the disc.</p>
    
    <h3>Custom versions</h3>
    <p>We are quite happy for people to make custom derivatives of TheOpenCD or to use the installer in other contexts. It is our goal to develop Orchard into a more complete build system that can be used by anyone to create derivative versions. For localised versions, you can either translate the HTML pages directly or make use of Orchard. If a certain application is not available in your language you may want to a) help translate it b) leave it out or c) leave the English version in place. </p>
    <p>If you make other substantial changes such as adding your own content, we ask that you change the branding to use a name different from TheOpenCD as this name is under trademark and is associated with a certain distribution. Thank you. </p>
<p>If you have questions about getting started, please stop by <a href="forum_web.lch">our forum</a>. Complete sources to the installer and the applications on the CD can be found <a href="source_web.lch">here</a>.</p><br />
