# XenFire-Xen based Soft Appliance #

## Introduction ##
Xenfire is a soft appliance that can be used to auto-install multiple virtual machines on a single physical server using the Xen virtualization technology. It can be useful for small and medium enterprises to consolidate their intranet servers and gateway server into one single physical server, while still preserving the administrative and security advantages of running two separate systems.

## Current Release ##
Xenfire2.0 is the first external release of Xenfire bootable CD-ROM iso image. It has a live CD to give demo/preview of Xenfire without having to install it to the harddisk. Once booted from the live CD, it gives users an interface to install Xenfire to the harddisk.

## User Interface ##
Xenfire also has an intutive Graphical User Interface based on X windows to make administration a breeze.

## License ##
Xenfire is an open-source project funded by Coriolis Technlogies Pvt. Ltd.

## Base Distribution ##
Xenfire 2.0 is based on Ubuntu Dapper LTS 6.06.1 release. It boots Ubuntu Dapper 6.0.6.1 LTS server for Dom0, and two virtual machines: VM1 and VM2. These domains and virtual machines have networking auto-configured using DHCP.

## Future ##
In the next Xenfire release, we plan to make virtual machines images and OS configurable from the installation menu.and provide ready-to-install Virtual machine OS images for various purposes e.g. web-server, mail-server, firewall, etc.
